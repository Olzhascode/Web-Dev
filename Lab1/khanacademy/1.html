        “There Will Come Soft Rain” by Sara Teasdale (Task-1)
    </h2>
    <p>
        There will come soft rain and the smell of the ground, <br>
        And swallows circling with their shimmering sound; <br>
        And frogs in the pools singing at night,<br>
        And wild plum trees in tremulous white; <br>
        Robins will wear their feathery fire, <br>
        Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire; <br>
        And not one will know of the war, not one <br>
        Will care at last when it is done. <br>
        Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree, <br>
        If mankind perished utterly; <br>
        And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn <br>
        Would scarcely know that we were gone. <br>

    <h2>You can learn anything (Task-2)</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Nobody’s born smart. We all start at 0</strong>. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
        <em>Slowly. Surely</em>. You <em>stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall</em>.<br>
        <em>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling</em>.</p><br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        <strong>Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger</strong>.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. learning.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        <strong>You just don’t get it, yet.</strong>
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        <strong>You can learn anything.</strong>
